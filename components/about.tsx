        <span className="italic">I began </span> my professional journey in 2008 as an application developer on a secret ü§´ government contract.
        During this time, I earned a graduate degree in engineering. Since then, I've worked across various industries and tech stacks,
        solving interesting problems and making lifelong friends along the way.

        <span className="italic">My favorite part about programming</span> is being able to easily volunteer my skillset to nonprofits and fun side projects, 
        whether that's creating a wedding vendor platform, an outdoor cat safety app or helping rescue dogs find a forever home üê∂. 
        I'm lucky to have skills that apply to so many different areas of life.

        with family, while watching "footie" matches ‚öΩÔ∏è, playing in a lively kickball league,
        <span className="font-medium"> and making improvements to my home</span>. I am currently
